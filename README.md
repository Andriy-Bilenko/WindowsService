# Currency Fetcher Service

Windows service application in C++ to fetch currency rates using data from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) API

## overview

-   `main.cpp` - console application entry point
-   `ServiceBase.h` and `ServiceBase.cpp` define the base class for our service. Has basic service features like registration with Service Control Manager (SCM), singleton architecture, ServiceMain, ServiceCtrlHandler and other functions that react to SCM directives.
-   `Service.h` and `Service.cpp` include main feature functionalities like fetching data from API and monitoring registers for changes to update the service behaviour during the runtime.
-   `ServiceManager.h` and `ServiceManager.cpp` includes functions that get called from `main.cpp` for managing service. Those functions include:
    -   RegisterServiceWithSCM - called when you run `Service.exe` without parameters. Intended to be run by SCM.
    -   InstallService - installs the service and writes to service registry default configurations
    -   RemoveService - removes the service
    -   StartService - starts the installed service (fetching data from API and monitoring registry changes)
    -   StopService - stops the installed service
    -   LoadConfigsFromFile - reads configurations from .ini file and puts them to the service registry on demand

## configuration and use

usage:
Make sure to have `cpprest_2_10.dll` in the same folder as executable and run under admin terminal.
```bash
Service.exe --install # required
Service.exe --load {filename.ini} # optional. SPECIFY FULL PATH TO .ini FILE, like "C:\\dir\\config.ini".
Service.exe --start # to actually start the service
#service started, writing logs and fetched data to respective files
Service.exe --load {filename.ini} # optional. SPECIFY FULL PATH TO .ini FILE. can load configurations in runtime and apply them instantly
Service.exe --stop # to stop the service. no longer fetches data / writes to files
Service.exe --remove # to get rid of the service from the computer. it is recommended to stop the service (if it was started) before removing it.
```

for example configuration file see `example_config.ini`

## dependencies

CppRestSdk from https://github.com/microsoft/cpprestsdk, a Windows-native C++ REST SDK developed by Microsoft for modern asynchronous C++ API design and calls.

Compile project with Microsoft Visual Studio, otherwise make sure to include `cpprest_2_10.dll` to the directory with `Service.exe`.

## troubleshooting

When service malfunctions pay close attention to error codes, either in terminal or service logs. Service logs are located in `C:\dir\default_logs.txt` by default (create `C:\dir\` or specify logs and data file by loading a new `config.ini`).

- if error says `InstallService(): OpenSCManager failed w/err 5` make sure you run it from admin terminal
- if error says `StartService(): Failed to start service. Error code: 2` move folder from Downloads to some other folder on disk
- if you see no outputs, like:
    ```
    PS C:\codes\abz.agency test task for C++ developer> .\Service.exe --install
    PS C:\codes\abz.agency test task for C++ developer> .\Service.exe --start
    PS C:\codes\abz.agency test task for C++ developer> .\Service.exe
    PS C:\codes\abz.agency test task for C++ developer>
    ```
    instead of
  ```
    PS C:\codes\abz.agency test task for C++ developer> .\Service.exe
    RegisterServiceWithSCM: Service failed to run w/err 1063
    this function should be ran by Service Control Manager and not from command line
    Parameters:
     --install  to install the service.
     --remove   to remove the service.
     --start   to start the service.
     --stop   to stop the service.
     --load {filename.ini}   to update service by loading configurations from a file.
    PS C:\codes\abz.agency test task for C++ developer> .\Service.exe --install
    AServiceName is installed
    PS C:\codes\abz.agency test task for C++ developer> .\Service.exe --start
    Service started successfully.
    PS C:\codes\abz.agency test task for C++ developer> .\Service.exe --load C:\example_config.ini
    PS C:\codes\abz.agency test task for C++ developer>
    ```
  make sure you have `cpprest_2_10.dll` in the same folder as `Service.exe`.

Google the error code number if nothing helps.
